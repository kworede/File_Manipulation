// The purpose of this assignment is to implementing a utility program that is similar to grep,
but without the ability to process regular expressions (i.e., a lot like a simple version of fgrep).

// The program take string words and files and print out lines that contains the string word

// The main function reads file form the user,compare if string match is occur and prints out matched line.

// It will output error message if the file can not be read or if it is not existed.
